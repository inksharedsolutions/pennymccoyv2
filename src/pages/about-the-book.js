                                        Penny McCoy went from being a world champion Alpine ski racer 
                                        at the age of sixteen to experiencing heartbreak in the following
                                        Olympics. This heartbreak affected every area of her life, 
                                        causing many wrong choices that stemmed from an identity of 
                                        brokenness. Penny is currently a vibrant vessel fulfilling her 
                                        God-given destiny by sharing God the Father's heart of life, 
                                        freedom, healing, goodness, hope, faithfulness, unfailing love, 
                                        release, and destiny through several avenues.
